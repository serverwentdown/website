              <p>
                Co-founder and lead software engineer. We're building a DAO
                focused on providing universal preventive healthcare and our
                mission is to add 10 billion healthy years to the planet.
              </p>
              <p>
                I researched protocols for decentralised data storage and wrote
                a specification for adding sharing primitives on top of a
                decentralised data storage protocol. I did initial work on a
                Dart library for the protocol. I also led the development of a
                prototype health superapp in Flutter using Scrum practices with
                sleep wellness content from NUS researchers, which we ran a
                pilot with 20+ participants.
              </p>
              <p>
                I helped set up the Requests for Discussion workflow and Design
                Thinking workflow for the team using Notion, and on-boarded
                everyone on the process.

                Worked on and was the team lead for a software engineering team
                to build a cybersecurity automation system in TypeScript and
                Next.js. I set up the development practices, worked with
                stakeholders to set requirements, did code review, integrated
                various systems, handled network and system administration.
